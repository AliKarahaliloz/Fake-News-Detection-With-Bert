In a letter sent to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the group that includes Amnesty International and UK legal charity Reprieve called for the release of Sayed Nazar Alwadaei, Hajar Mansoor Hasan and Mahmood Marzooq Mansoor. The three are relatives of Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei and his wife Duaa Alwadaei. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei is the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, a Britain-based group campaigning for political change in Bahrain. The three were arrested in March in Bahrain while Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei was attending the 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  We therefore urge your government to request Bahrain to immediately release Mr and Mrs Alwadaei s relatives ahead of their October 30 trial and drop all charges against them,  said the letter sent on Thursday. It called the case  part of a pattern of abuse and harassment against human rights defenders and their families in Bahrain . The letter said the three detainees are facing up to three years in jail.  Bahrain is punishing his innocent family as retribution for his peaceful activism,  said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Bahrain s government officials could not be immediately reached for a comment. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei s family members have been under the spotlight of Bahrain s authorities since he took part in protest against the attendance of the Gulf state s king at a royal horse show in Britain. King Hamad attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show last year, and the state-run Bahrain News Agency BNA published his photographs with Britain s Queen Elizabeth II. Bahrain, which has a Shi ite Muslim majority population and is ruled by a Sunni royal family, has seen unrest since the  Arab Spring  protests across the region in 2011.  Many of Bahrain s Shi ites say they suffer discrimination, which the government denies. It accuses Shi ite power Iran of fomenting unrest on its soil, a charged Tehran denies. \",\n          \"Very few of Donald Trump s fans are more blindly loyal to him than former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, but Trump s behavior of late has really pissed some people off, including Newt Gingrich. Trump has denigrated the family of a fallen Iraq soldier, he s kicked a mother with a crying baby out of a rally, bashed his fellow Republicans, accepted a Purple Heart from a soldier for no other reason than to show it off, and said he thinks his own daughter should just get a new job if she s being sexually harassed at work.In short, Trump is imploding, taking the GOP with him, and to Gingrich, that is  unacceptable.  In fact, he used that very word when describing what s happening: The current race is which of these two is the more unacceptable, because right now neither of them is acceptable.Trump is helping [Hillary] to win by proving he is more unacceptable than she is. He also dropped this bomb on Trump s election chances: He cannot win the presidency operating the way he is now. [Hillary] can t be bad enough to elect him if he s determined to make this many mistakes. Now, Gingrich isn t saying he ll endorse or vote for Hillary. But he stopped being Trump s apologist for a moment, and is even one of the Republicans that s working on staging an intervention for Trump. They re hoping to get him to change course before the damage to their party is irreversible.Trump has also refused to endorse either Paul Ryan or John McCain in their re-election races, proving yet again that he would rather pick petty fights over imagined slights than actually focus on running for president. To Gingrich, he s still acting like it s primary season, and like he s still competing against 17 other candidates.Don t let Trump hear him say any of this, though! Gingrich so pansy-assed about this that he furiously tried to backpedal on Twitter. Maybe he thinks that Trump won t notice his comments if he pretends the media is making this up?Media has wildly misinterpreted my critique of a bad week for Trump. Trump is vastly better than Hillary as President.

According to Stephaopoulos, is rarely incorrect in his predictions. Was Silver considering the effect voter fraud would have on our elections that appears to be almost exclusively favoring Democrats?FAST FORWARD TO August, 2017, as America witnesses one report after anohter of unbelievable voter fraud and/or major voter discrepancies across several states in America.  Americans are finally starting to understand how the Democrats, and their allies in the media were so certain that Hillary would win against the much more popular candidate Donald J. Trump:National Review   Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among America s adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to voter fraud.The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch   a Washington-based legal-watchdog group   analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau s 2011 2015 American Community Survey and last month s statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. According to Judicial Watch, eleven states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvania s legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.My tabulation of Judicial Watch s state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties. That s enough over-registered voters to populate a ghost-state about the size of Connecticut,  Judicial Watch attorney Robert Popper told me.Take a look at the margin in battle ground states Trump won in 2016, in which Electoral College votes can be decided by incredibly narrow margins. Consider the multitude of ghost voters in:Colorado: 159,373Florida: 100,782Iowa: 31,077Michigan: 225,235New Hampshire: 8,211North Carolina: 189,721Virginia: 89,979(For a deeper dive into these data, please download my spreadsheet here.)President Donald J. Trump s supporters might be intrigued to learn that Hillary Clinton s margins of victory in Colorado (136,386) and New Hampshire (2,736) were lower than the numbers of ghost voters in those states. Clinton s fans should know that Trump won Michigan (10,704) and North Carolina (173,315) by fewer ballots than ghost voters in those states.It s past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.Watch Barack Obama criticize Donald Trump for questioning the integrity of the vote: \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 6, 2016\",\n          \"Aug 30, 2016\",\n          \"July 8, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
